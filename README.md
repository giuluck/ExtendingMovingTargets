# Extending the Moving Targets Method for Injecting Constraints in Machine Learning

_Moving Targets_ is a state-of-the-art algorithm "for injecting constraints at training time in supervised learning, based on decomposition and bi-level optimization" (Detassis, Lombardi, Milano: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10766).

In this project, which is currently being developed for a Master's Thesis in Artificial Intelligence at the _Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna_, the original formulation of the algorithm is extended to deal with semi-supervised learning techniques and to enforce soft constraints - in particular, monotonicity shape constraints.

The provided code can be used to replicate all the experiments on the algorithm itself and on the other methods used for benchmarking.
